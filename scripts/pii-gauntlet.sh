# pii-gauntlet.sh — verify no PII leaked into plessas-marketplace.
#
# TWO MODES:
#   --mode=ci      Scan only git-tracked files. Used by GitHub Actions to gate
#                  pushes. Any hit = FAIL = exit 1.
#   --mode=doctor  (default) Scan the entire working tree. Distinguishes tracked
#                  hits (FAIL — these would ship publicly) from gitignored hits
#                  (INFO — local-only, never pushed). Exit 1 only on tracked hits.
#
# Why two modes:
#   The CI mode is the actual safety gate.
#   The doctor mode helps the maintainer notice PII drift in their LOCAL files
#   before they accidentally `git add` something. It must NOT scare a teammate
#   running the script casually — "FAIL" on a gitignored file would teach them
#   to ignore the script entirely, defeating the point.
#
# Self-exclusion: this script contains the very patterns it searches for, so
# `--exclude=pii-gauntlet.sh` is essential to avoid self-match false positives.

# These are patterns, not names, so publishing them discloses nothing. They are
# also the checks that were missing entirely: the four exposures found in the
# 2026-08-24 audit all passed the gauntlet green, because nothing here looked
# for the employer's name, its mail domain, or a tenant hostname.

# Placeholders are the whole point of a good example, so they must not trip the
# check that exists to catch the real thing. Without these excludes the gauntlet
# flags `contoso.sharepoint.com` (the correct placeholder) and its own CHANGELOG
# entries describing the removal of the real host. A check that fires on
# deliberate, already-disclosed content teaches you to ignore it, which is how
# the four real exposures sat unnoticed next to a green gauntlet.
# Doc placeholders. Extend this when a new invented example host trips the check:
# being asked once "is this a real tenant?" is the check doing its job, and is a
# far better failure mode than the silence it replaces.
#
# Every exclusion below names a placeholder VALUE. None of them exempts a FILE.
#
# There used to be a PLACEHOLDER_PATH='example|sample|template', passed as the
# path argument to the employer-name, mail-domain and tenant checks. Unanchored
# and matched as a substring against the path of every hit, it exempted whole
# files outright: any path merely containing "example", "sample" or "template"
# was invisible to all three checks, and those are precisely the files where a
# real address or tenant gets pasted in as "realistic" sample data. Measured
# over this repo's tracked tree the token exempted 0 files today, so removing it
# changes no verdict here and closes the hole before it opens.
#
# The path argument to `check` still exists for a file that genuinely cannot be
# scanned, but it must then be an anchored, named path with a comment saying
# why, never a substring.
PLACEHOLDER='contoso|firstname\.lastname|your\.email|recipient\.name'

# The tenant check used to carry a list of fixture hostnames, exempted so that
# test code and help strings would not trip it. Two things were wrong with it.
#
# 1. The alternation ended in the bare letters a, b, x, y and z. Unanchored, a
#    single-letter entry matches the LAST CHARACTER of any real tenant: `x`
#    exempts onyx.sharepoint.com, and `y` exempts every OneDrive host on earth
#    via the `y` of `-my.sharepoint.com`.
# 2. Not one of the twelve names on it appears anywhere in this repo. Grepped
#    over the tracked tree, this repo contains no `.sharepoint.com` string at
#    all outside this script: it is the Teams CLI, and SharePoint is another
#    repo's surface. Every entry was a live exemption for a host nobody had
#    written, guarding nothing.
#
# So the list is gone entirely rather than trimmed. The tenant check now runs
# with only the generic doc placeholders. If a SharePoint fixture is ever added
# here, the check will fire on it once, which is the check doing its job; add
# that one name back, anchored with `(^|[^a-z0-9.-])` so it must be a whole
# host label, and say in a comment where it is used.
