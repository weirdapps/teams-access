# TWO MODES:
#   --mode=ci      Scan only git-tracked files. Used by GitHub Actions to gate
#                  pushes. Any hit = FAIL = exit 1.
#   --mode=doctor  (default) Scan the entire working tree. Distinguishes tracked
#                  hits (FAIL — these would ship publicly) from gitignored hits
#                  (INFO — local-only, never pushed). Exit 1 only on tracked hits.
#
# Why two modes:
#   The CI mode is the actual safety gate.
#   The doctor mode helps the maintainer notice PII drift in their LOCAL files
#   before they accidentally `git add` something. It must NOT scare a teammate
#   running the script casually — "FAIL" on a gitignored file would teach them
#   to ignore the script entirely, defeating the point.
#
# Self-exclusion: this script contains the very patterns it searches for, so
# `--exclude=pii-gauntlet.sh` is essential to avoid self-match false positives.

# The case-SENSITIVE scan path -- the third one, beside scan_doctor and scan_ci
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# scan_doctor and scan_ci both pass -i and both must keep it. Folding case is
# right for a mail domain and a tenant host, and adding it to scan_ci is what
# closed the gap where the push GATE was weaker than the local doctor. But an
# ALL-CAPS Greek personal name is a SHAPE, and -i turns "two capitalised Greek
# words" into "two Greek words", which matches ordinary Greek prose. Relaxing
# either existing scanner to host that rule would trade a real catch for a
# shape one. So there is a third path instead, and these two are the exact
# twins of scan_ci and scan_paths, differing only in the missing -i.
#
# CS_FILES is the part neither twin has. A grep over an empty file list prints
# nothing and exits 1, which is indistinguishable from a clean tree, and this
# file has shipped that exact false green before: it once reported OK on every
# check while, on macOS, scanning zero files. The count is printed on every run
# and check_shape refuses to report OK when it is zero.
#
# Doctor mode adds untracked-but-not-ignored files, so the population is
# exactly "everything that could ship". It therefore never emits INFO, unlike
# the -i checks, which also read gitignored files. Ignored files are dropped by
# --exclude-standard rather than by a hand-maintained --exclude-dir list, so
# the two cannot drift apart.
#
# core.quotePath=false on every one of these, and it is load-bearing. By
# default `git ls-files` renders a non-ASCII path as a quoted C string of octal
# bytes, "\316\244\316\225...", so TREE_PATHS above cannot see a Greek filename
# at all, and worse, a Greek-named file's CONTENTS are never opened either:
# xargs hands grep a filename that does not exist and the error goes to
# /dev/null. That hole is pre-existing and shared by the -i checks, which are
# left alone here. A Greek-name check that inherited it would be structurally
# blind to the one filename it exists to catch. Set per invocation, never in

# These are patterns, not names, so publishing them discloses nothing. They are
# also the checks that were missing entirely: the four exposures found in the
# 2026-08-24 audit all passed the gauntlet green, because nothing here looked
# for the employer's name, its mail domain, or a tenant hostname.

# Placeholders are the whole point of a good example, so they must not trip the
# check that exists to catch the real thing. Without these excludes the gauntlet
# flags `contoso.sharepoint.com` (the correct placeholder) and its own CHANGELOG
# entries describing the removal of the real host. A check that fires on
# deliberate, already-disclosed content teaches you to ignore it, which is how
# the four real exposures sat unnoticed next to a green gauntlet.
# Doc placeholders. Extend this when a new invented example host trips the check:
# being asked once "is this a real tenant?" is the check doing its job, and is a
# far better failure mode than the silence it replaces.
#
# Every exclusion below names a placeholder VALUE. None of them exempts a FILE.
#
# There used to be a PLACEHOLDER_PATH='example|sample|template', passed as the
# path argument to the employer-name, mail-domain and tenant checks. Unanchored
# and matched as a substring against the path of every hit, it exempted whole
# files outright: any path merely containing "example", "sample" or "template"
# was invisible to all three checks, and those are precisely the files where a
# real address or tenant gets pasted in as "realistic" sample data. Measured
# over this repo's tracked tree the token exempted 0 files today, so removing it
# changes no verdict here and closes the hole before it opens.
#
# The path argument to `check` still exists for a file that genuinely cannot be
# scanned, but it must then be an anchored, named path with a comment saying
# why, never a substring.
PLACEHOLDER='contoso|firstname\.lastname|your\.email|recipient\.name'

# The tenant check used to carry a list of fixture hostnames, exempted so that
# test code and help strings would not trip it. Two things were wrong with it.
#
# 1. The alternation ended in the bare letters a, b, x, y and z. Unanchored, a
#    single-letter entry matches the LAST CHARACTER of any real tenant: `x`
#    exempts onyx.sharepoint.com, and `y` exempts every OneDrive host on earth
#    via the `y` of `-my.sharepoint.com`.
# 2. Not one of the twelve names on it appears anywhere in this repo. Grepped
#    over the tracked tree, this repo contains no `.sharepoint.com` string at
#    all outside this script: it is the Teams CLI, and SharePoint is another
#    repo's surface. Every entry was a live exemption for a host nobody had
#    written, guarding nothing.
#
# So the list is gone entirely rather than trimmed. The tenant check now runs
# with only the generic doc placeholders. If a SharePoint fixture is ever added
# here, the check will fire on it once, which is the check doing its job; add
# that one name back, anchored with `(^|[^a-z0-9.-])` so it must be a whole

#
# Two consecutive all-caps Greek words is how Greek corporate systems write a
# person: SURNAME FORENAME. This closes a class the private denylist
# structurally cannot, because a denylist only ever holds the names somebody
# remembered to add. It was found the hard way: a real colleague's full name
# sat in a tracked test file of a PUBLIC repo from its first commit, with the
# denylist loaded and the gauntlet printing PASS every single run.
#
# Greek capitals are enumerated ONE CODEPOINT AT A TIME as an alternation, not
# as the range [<Alpha>-<Omega>] and not as a bracket set. Both of those are
# resolved by the LOCALE: in a UTF-8 locale each letter is one collating
# element, and under C or POSIX the same expression decays into its individual
# BYTES. Measured with a bracket form of this rule over a fixture: 4 hits under
# en_US.UTF-8 and C.UTF-8, 5 under C and POSIX, because the length quantifier
# then counts bytes and a two-letter word (4 bytes) clears a three-CHARACTER
# minimum. The rule would mean something different on the runner than on the
# maintainer's laptop, which is the bug that already bit this project once: a
# multibyte range that resolved on BSD and not on GNU passed all through
# development, then reported nothing on the first ubuntu run. An alternation of
# literal characters has no collation to get wrong. Measured 3 hits on the same
# fixture under all four locales.
#
# The class is the 24 plain capitals plus the two dialytika forms, which Greek
# all-caps preserves. The seven tonos-bearing capitals are deliberately absent,
# because Greek all-caps drops the tonos. The cost is a miss on a name emitted
# with an accent left on, where the letter run breaks at that letter. Stated,
# not hidden.

# four-letter Greek forenames. Four is the knee. It also kills the acronym
# class outright, since every Greek acronym in use across these repos is two or
# three letters, along with every Greek article, conjunction and preposition
# that would otherwise pair with the noun after it.
#
# Deliberately NOT required: that the pair be alone on its line or bounded by
